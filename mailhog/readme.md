# mailhog

## Description

For your development purposes, the ideal solution is MailHog, a simple and lightweight containerized mail server specifically designed for testing and development scenarios. MailHog captures outgoing emails without actually sending them, allowing you to review them through a convenient web interface.

## Why MailHog

1. Simple setup: Easy to deploy with minimal configuration.
2. Local-only: Captures emails locally without external delivery.
3. Web Interface: Provides a built-in web UI to review captured emails.
4. Docker-friendly: Can be easily run as a Docker container.

## How to set up MailHog with Docker

1. run the docker compose file

    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. Configure your application to use MailHog as an SMTP server:
    1. SMTP Host: localhost
    2. SMTP Port: 1025
    3. No authentication required.
    4. Access the MailHog Web Interface:
    5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8025 to view captured emails

This setup ensures that all outgoing emails generated by your application during development are stored locally and easily accessible for review, without the risk of accidentally sending emails externally.
